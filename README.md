# Electrical-Tricycle-Design-

- Technologie III
- Team of 6 students

•	In this project, our objective was to design an electric tricycle. 

•	We started by researching the specifications and needs of the ones we want, such as functionality, speed, weight, systems, size, road conditions, region we work with, etc.

•	Then we estimated the total masses, and estimated the power needed to choose the electric motor.

•	We note that all the components of the project must exist in reality and can be purchased (electric motor, battery, braking system, and the components of the tricycle body taking into account the size of each (shaft, pipes, etc.), etc.)

•	We need to know the manufacturing processes of each selected components, from the raw material to the part used (for example, the different phases of shaft manufacturing: sawing, surfacing, turning, chamfering, threading, milling, etc.)

•	The parts of the project are distributed among us after making the necessary studies, and then they are assembled in the final design with the main accessories (shock absorber, disc brake, sprocket, motor, battery, chair, bearings, etc.)

•	A budget is estimated for the entire design and a cost schedule based on online pricing is established, including some answers for specialized workers in certain parts.

•	Finally, shop drawings are made in order to give this file to the people in charge of manufacturing and processing these parts.


•	Output of the project: 
  o	SolidWorks files
  o	Report
  o	Shop drawings file

•	Skills token from this project:
  -	SolidWorks
  -	Dealing with reality (all project components must exist in real life)
  -	Manufacturing Processes
  -	Assembly & Disassembly
  -	Shop Drawings
